    <!--Course Overview here-->
    <p class="degree-overview">If have not already realised from the home page, the degree I am studying is a bachelor degree in Computer Science
      with a year in industry which is a 4 year course. Which means the third year I shall find a work placement. 
      The course is accredited by the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/">British Computer Society</a>
      During the degree I will learn to understand theoretical issues of problems and how to implement solutions. Furthermore, I 
      will learn how to program more and develop my thinking analytically skills alongside developing teamwork and comunication skills.
      Below I give an overview of the modules that I will study in year one of my degree.

      <p class="information">
        This module is a two semester (year) long module that introduces us to Software Engineering concepts
        that are needed to develop software systems that can meet a set of functional requirements within a problem domain.
        This is from aquiring the requirements of clients , to implementing a solution and testing that our solution meets 
        the requirements set out by the client. During the first semester we have had lectures which help us understand this 
        process and the different ways of working in teams. We have then put this into practice by meeting with our clients
        (4th year students) online due to the coronavirus pandemic. During meetings we have obtained the requirements of a 
        solution which we are going to implement next semester. As well as this you learn about a programming language called 
        ruby which is a nice programming language to use in my personal opinion. This also complements the lectures as you learn
        how to work in a team to program a solution using remote reposities to share and collaborate work. To test our understanding
        of programming in ruby there is an individual assignment.

      <p class="information">
        This module is another year long module. It introduces us to mathematical concepts and techniques that are of great
        importance in the field of computer science. During the first semester we have looked at propositional logic, set theory
        , predicate logic, boolean algebra, mathematical functions, relations, proof by induction, proof by contradiction,
        induction recursion and BNF.

    <article class="main-content">
      <p class="information">
        This module is a year long. It introduces us to the Java programming language. The aim of this module is to by the
        end be able to write clear, readable, maintainable programs in java. We should then be able to test these programs 
        to produce a desired outcome. During semester one we have looked at the following but not limited to programming
        techniques: Variables and their types, inputs and outputs, manipulation of strings and characters, selection techniques,
        Enums, arrays and their manipulation, graphics (Image shows example work), Object Oriented Programming, classes, objects, methods, making and using 
        packages and documenting our programs.

    <article class="main-content">
      <p class="information">
        COM 1005 - Machines and Intelligence is a year long module. In this module we are introduced to the key concepts and
        problems in Artifical Intelligence. A key problem is whether a machine will actually ever be able to think for itself.
        We get to evaluate whether the turing test is sufficent enough, if a machine passes it, to claim we can actually call
        it a thinking machine or not.
        We discover the moral and ethical issues that are raised by producing such machines. In this module we are introduced
        to the history of AI and we get to look at the open questions of major sub areas of AI. In this module we have a practical
        component that intoduces AI problem solving, being able to indentify the abstract nature of problems to be solved. During 
        the first semester of the module we had experience of programming the Miro-e robot(not the one on the left) more on Miro robot
        can be found <a href="http://consequentialrobotics.com/">here</a>.

    <article class="main-content">
      <p class="information">
        COM 1006 - Devices and Networks is an optional year long module on the course. In devices we look at system architectures
        This invloves: digital logic such as the logic gates (AND,OR,NOT,EXCLUSIVE OR GATES) and then looking at techniques as to how we can simplify circuits
        that involve a combination of these gates joined together. We also look at sequential logic and circuits. Furthermore, we look at computer arithmetic this includes 
        looking at looking how to add binary numbers, convert denary numbers to binary and converting to hexadecimal and looking 
        at floating point. Near to the end of the semester one we look at the structure of the CPU , assembly language programming
        and instruction structure. In the second semester of the year we will be switching our focus towards networks, how we can connect our
        devices into a network. We shall also cover the principles of layered protocols and reliable transmission over networks.

    <article class="main-content">
      <p class="information">
        COM 1008 - Web and internet technology is a one semester long module worth 10 credits. This module covers the basics
        of technologies that are used in Web development at the front-end such as making websites using programming lanaguages
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, it emphaises on the need of making a website using mobile-first responsive web design. 
        Towards the end of the module we look at how to draw graphics on webpages using the canvas or Scalable Vector Graphics. Also near the end
        of the module we look at networks and information security. Furthermore in this module, we get to look at the history of the internet and web and briefly how it has become possible for the 
        birth of this technology, which a large part of the world depends upon everyday and much more so during the coronavirus pandemic.

    <article class="main-content">
      <p class="information">
        COM 1009 - Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures is a one semester long module worth 10 credits. Algorithms play
        a huge part in Computer Science. This module introduces design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures. We will 
        look what algorithmic solutions are efficent and measure the efficiency of different algorithms. We will look at how to design these
        efficent algorithms. We will also look at efficient data structures for storing and retrieving data. We will look at fundamental problems
        such as searching, sorting, graph algorithms and combinatorial problems such as finding the shortest paths in networks.
