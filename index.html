      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p >Hello!  I am a first year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at The
           University Of Sheffield. I have previous education of Computer Science which includes studying the subject at GCSE level 
           and as an A Level. I throughly enjoy Computer Science and wish to share with your some of my experiences so far while 
           studying the subject at university.

      <h2 > Hobby</h2>
      <p>In my own time which is mostly at weekends and when coronavirus restrictions are not in place as they are at the time of writing this
         (tier 3 / lockdown &#9785;) I usually meet up with family and friends and go watch Sheffield United who I have 
         supported since being young. Being a supporter of Sheffield united has given me many highs and lows. The best part of 
         supporting them is that all supporters stick together through the lows. Being a season ticket holder allows me to make new friends
         as new season starts sometimes you can be sat around people who you have never met before. Lately watching games means being fixed 
         to a tv screen during the matches and seeing no friends or making new friends. 
         I will never forget the announcement made on my 18th birthday in 2020, that football matches were to be suspended. 
         A birthday rememberable for the wrong reasons not only because of coronavirus. </p>
